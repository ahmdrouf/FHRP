Examples of such protocols include (in approximate order of creation):

Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) - Cisco's initial, proprietary standard developed in 1998[3]
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) - an open (albeit patent encumbered) standard protocol
Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) - patent-free unencumbered alternative to Cisco's HSRP developed in October 2003
Extreme Standby Router Protocol (ESRP) - Extreme Networks' proprietary standard with fast failover and also layer 2 protection
Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP) - a more recent proprietary standard from Cisco that permits load balancing as well as redundancy
Routed Split multi-link trunking (R-SMLT) - an Avaya redundancy protocol
NetScreen Redundancy Protocol (NSRP) - a Juniper Networks proprietary router redundancy protocol providing load balancing
Chassis Cluster Redundant Ethernet - a Juniper Networks proprietary Ethernet redundancy protocol, used on its SRX platform[4]
Multi-active Gateway Protocol (MAGP) - a Mellanox proprietary protocol based on VRRP that allows active-active operation[5]
